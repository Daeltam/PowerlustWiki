        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <div id="FAQ">
            <p>*When is the **next update**?* <br>
                No idea, I just released one.<br>
                
                *How is **PC version** different?*<br>
                It has a bunch of benefits:<br>
                - All donation bonuses unlocked.<br>
                - Better VFX and texture resolution.<br>
                - Keyboard and mouse controls.<br>
                - More PC friendly UI<br>
                
                *Do unique/legendary item **perks stack**?* <br>
                Not, if they are the same. +15%/+25% weapondamage = spellpower are different perks.<br>
                
                *How to get **set items**?*<br>
                You can find them during normal gameplay. You will also be able to buy them from the paid vendor after you reach lvl 50.<br>
                
                *How **set items** work?*<br>
                There are different sets. You need to have at least 2 items from the same set to start getting perks from it.
                You will need items with the same bonuses shown. <br>
                
                *Do bonuses like fire magic, spellpower, elemental dmg bonus increase the damage of fire arrow?*<br>
                Yes, I tried all of the bonuses to work based on logic.<br>
                
                *What affects the strength of heal/imbue **unique item perks***<br>
                It's based on the same things corresponding spells are.<br>
                
                *What is the **max level**?*<br>
                50. After that there are a lot of legend levels that give 1 mastery point per level and 1 talent point all 10 levels.<br>
                
                *Is the **speed** stat movement speed or attack speed?*<br>
                It's movement only.<br>
                
                *What is the best item type?*<br>
                normal < magic < rare < epic < unique < set & legendary
                Crafted items are strong depending on how you craft them. See Crafting in "others"<br>
                
                *What benefits the Necromancer **summons**?*<br>
                Spellpower and spell level boosts damage. Spellpower and Necromancy mastery level increases health. Crit chance & crit dmg is based on character stats.<br>
                
                *Can I buy **town portal** scrolls?*<br>
                Yes. You can purchase them from the barrel next to the portal (in town).<br>
                
                *Is **polearm** a 2 handed weapon?*<br>
                No, bonuses for 2handed weapons don't work on polearms but you still need two hands.<br>
                
                *Will I lose my donation status when I **switch to another phone**?*<br>
                No, if you use the same google play account, you will have access to the donation rewards on your new phone.<br>
                
                *How does **Crafting** work?*<br>
                Go to the blacksmith. You can combine 5 items into 1. Base item is taken for base stats (armor, mres, weapon dmg, etc.). You can pick 1 stat per item from the other 4 items. Max 2 unique/legendary perk</p>
                <p>
                    **Cloud save**<br>
                    Cloud save is manual, you have to go to main menu and save your characters before you can download them on another device. **Please make sure you wait for the save to be done, before quitting!** It can take a while.<br>

                    **Guide for copying save files:**<br>
                    There are 3 ways right now how you can do it; cloud save, manual export/Import (textfile) and copy from folders. Unfortunately they all have their problems.<br>
                    - Cloud save is for some reason not 100% reliable, sometimes not all chars are copied. You can try it multiple times and it might work. Better dont delete the game if not all chars are available.
                    - Manual import/export is based on a textfile which might be too long even when selecting slim.<br>
                    - Copy from folder, but you probably need an extra programm to get access to your files (fv file explorer for example).<br>
                    So how do they work? ⬇️<br>
                    - Cloud save: Settings -> cloud save -> log in -> save/load from cloud. Pretty easy<br>
                    - Manual import/export: Settings -> cloud save -> manual export -> export (/import) -> slim save -> copy text-> paste it into email, textfile or whereever it works and then send it to your other phone and import the textfile with copy/paste from clipboard<br>
                    - Access your folders: Save files are located in internal storage -> android -> data -> bartmamzer.powerlust.actionrpg.roguelike -> files. Just copy them.<br>

                    **Be careful when deleting/reinstalling the game, saves will be deleted.**<br>
                    *How to move **saves** to another phone?* - Save files are located in internal storage -> android -> data -> bartmamzer.powerlust.actionrpg.roguelike -> files<br>
                    If you can't see anything in the data folder it means your current file app doesn't have the rights to see them. You can access them from a PC or with some other file explorer on the phone.
                    <br>
                    *Why I can't watch **ads**?*<br>
                    - Ads require the internet and also might not be available at a specific country. If that's not the case then there's also the case of the device. On some devices ads are disabled, because they were causing ANR errors.

                    Multiplayer
                    <br>
                    Someone has to open a game and players who want to join need<br>
                    - __**server region **__ (Europe, us, etc)<br>
                    - __**exact name**__ (UPPER lower case)<br>
                    - same version. Tester version and/or different public versions sometimes dont work together<br>
                    - eventually difficulty because hc chars stay dead<br>
                    - and maybe level. The enemy level is based on hosts characterlevel<br>
                    - host and/or guest need to move atleast a bit to get xp and stuff<br>
                    - if you want to help someone level up you can only use up to PL19<br>
